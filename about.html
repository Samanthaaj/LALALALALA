    <h1>The Creation of Rosales National High School</h1>
    <p>Rosales National High School was founded through the inititativeof town officials and civic-spirited citizens, including Mayor Felix Coloma, Do√±a Petra Callanta, 
        Don Francisco Delos Reyes, Don Isidro Casanova, and Don Conrado  Estrella Sr. Initially, classes were held temporarily in the Plaridel building due to the aftermath of World War II.<br><br><br>
        The school was then moved to a site previously occupied by American soldiers, using Quonset huts as classrooms. The founding fathers and PTA secured a permanent location, a 72,634-square-meter lot,
        through donations and community efforts. The new sites cost P50,843.20 as down payment. Plaridel College donated facilities to furnish the new school building.<br><br><br>
        The school has significantly grown since its founding, increasing in size, curriculum, and student population. As of March 4, 2018, it had approximately 5,151 enrollees, making it one of the largest national high schools in the Division of Pangasinan II.
        The school's teaching methods have also evolved, shifting towards a more hands-on, practical approach to learning.

        <div><h1>Mandate</h1><br><br><p>The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863 as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction under a Chairman. 
            The Education agency underwent many reorganization efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the changing administrations and charters. 
            The present day Department of Education was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes the mandate of this agency.<br><br>

            The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and coordinates policies, plans, programs and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal basic education. 
            It supervises all elementary and secondary education institutions, including alternative learning systems, both public and private; and provides for the establishment 
            and maintenance of a complete, adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.</p></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
