            <p>What is Stem?<br>

                The STEM strand teaches students how to apply math, science, engineering, and technology to solve real-world problems, fostering critical thinking and collaboration skills.<br><br><br>
                
                The Objectives of the Stem strand<br><br>
                
                -Have developed a keener sense of creativity and ingenuity which is essential in coming up with new ideas and innovations<br>
                 -Be more inclined to experiment and be more open to risks<br>
                 -Be able to apply the knowledge they’ve learned in class in everyday scenarios, most especially in their future courses<br>
                 -Have the foundational competencies that will allow them to excel in their chosen courses and, eventually, help them qualify for jobs in the STEM strand<br><br>
                
                Advantages of the STEM Strand<br><br>
                
                -Builds resilience in a safe environment by allowing students to experiment and to naturally experience failures as part of the learning process<br>
                 -Encourages teamwork so students can find solutions to problems, record data, write reports, give presentations, and prepare them for STEM strand jobs<br>
                 -Teaches kids about the power and importance of technology, especially in today’s digital age<br>
                 -Fosters a habit of adaption when things don’t go as planned<br><br>
